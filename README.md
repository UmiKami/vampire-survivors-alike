# Objective

The objective of this project is to get used to the Godot game engine and get better at game design. This would be a survivors game similar to vampire survivors but with much less content as this is only for learning purposes and not meant to be released / published.


## Known Issues

1. Camera jittering / blurry player sprite when moving perpendicular to the X and Y axis. This is an engine issue that has been reported. There isn't much I can do about this with my current knowledge.
